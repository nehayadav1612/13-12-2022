What is a language?
	Its used for communication.
	
What are the things a language consists?
	alphabets
	grammer
	

What is a computer language?
	It's used to communicate with the computer.
	
Binary Language (or) Machine Level Language (or) Low Level Language

(0,1)

	

High Level Language
	Its equalent to English(a-z), numbers(0-9), and some special character(&, @, +, = etc).
	
	C, C++, C#, Python, Java etc.
	
	The computer will not understand the HLL.
	
	keywords are like alphabets of a HLL.
	
	syntax like grammer of a HLL.
	
	
	
	
Java compiler
	It will convert the java program into byte code (not binary code).
	
Java interpreter	
	It will convert java byte code into binary code.
	
To execute a java progran we require

1. java compiler

2. java interpreter

3. editor

Steps to execute a java program.
1. Write your program by using any editor.

	You must save your program by using a name with an extension .java.
	
	While saving your program give the name of your class ande .java(First.java)

2. You have to compile the program by using the following command.

	>javac First.java

3. You need to execute the program by using the following command.
	
	>java First (dont give First.class)


	
	
	
You must install jdk in our system to compile and execute the program.

Java means "Write Once Run Anywhere".

1. After compiling the java program, we will get .class file.

2. Later you can this .class file in any other computer, and interpret your program. 

1. JDK == Java Development Kit
2. JRE == Java Runtime Environment
3. JVM == Java Virtual Machine

In java
1. Every program must be written inside a class.

2. Inside your class you must write a method or function main().

	Function or method are two types
		1. simple (void)
		
		2. return type (int, double, String , etc)
	
3. To run a program you must call your function(main()).
	
	1. In general we want to call a function (method) with an object in any oops language.

	First f = new First();
	
	f.main();
	
	But without creating any object for our class we are able to excute main() method. But how?
	
	Because the "static" keyword.
	
	To call a static method, there is no rule to create any object to the class.
	
	Here main() method automatically called by the java runtime, thats why main() should defined with static main().
	
	System.out.println() --> is used to display anything on computer's output device.
	
		
		1. println() is a method
		2. out is an object
		3. System is a class.
		
	When you want to write a java program, we must get help from existing java libray.
	
	
Data?
Steps in a program.

1. accept data (input)
2. process the accepted data
3. show the data (output)

Datatype: The type of data our program deals with.

Datatypes
1. int == 4 bytes (32 bits) 
2. float
3. long
4. double
5. char
6. boolean
7. String(class)

Data Type	Size	Description

byte		1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127

short		2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767

int			4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to
													2,147,483,647
long		8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from 		
			-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

float		4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for 
			storing 6 to 7 decimal digits

double		8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for 
			storing 15 decimal digits

boolean		1 bit	Stores true or false values

char		2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter or unicode 
				values

int n1 = 10.5;

int n2 = 20;

int r = n1 + n2;

n1 = 30;

System.out.println(r);	

here n1, n2 and r are variables.

	
Eclipse

IDE ==> Integrated Development Environment.

Java Project: Where we can save number of java programs.


int/int = int
int/double = double
double/int = double
double/double = double

By default a fractional number (3.14) will be stored in double.

Operators
1. Simple
	= -> Assignment operator
	int n1 = 100;
	
2. Arithmetic Operators
+, -, *, / (quotient) % (modulus or remaindor)

3. Comparision Operators
>, <, >=, <=, ==, != 
output: boolean(t/f)

int n1 = 100;
int n2 = 200;

n1 > n2 = f
n2 > n1 = t

n1 == n2 = f

n1 != n2 = t

4. Logical Operators
AND, OR, NOT
&&, ||, !

Truth Table
1. &&

C1		&&		C2			Result
T				T			T
T				F			F
F				T			F
F				F			F

2. ||

C1		||		C2			Result	
T				T			T
T				F			T
F				T			T
F				F			F

3. !

C		!C
T		F
F		T



Condition?
	Either "true" or "false"
	
	20 > 10 == True
	20 < 10 == False
	
	
Programming Constructs

1. Decision Constructs
	1.if
	
		if(conditon) {
			process;
		}
		
		
		
		1. if the conditon is "true", the process will be executing.
		
		2. if the conditon is "false", nothing will be executing.
		
	
	2. if else
	
		if(condition) {
			process1;
		}
		else {
			process2;
		}
		
		1. if the conditon is "true", the process1 will be executing.
		
		2. if the conditon is "false", the process2 will be executing.
		
		
	3. if else if
	4. switch
	
2. Looping Constructs
	1. while
		
		while(condition) {
			process;
		}
		
		
		
		
	2. do while
	3. for
	4. for each
	
Comments in the program

1. Single line comment

// line 1


2. multi lines comment
/*
line 1
line 2

*/

Steps in a program.

1. accept data (input).
2. validate the input(s).
3. process the accepted data
4. show the data (output).
